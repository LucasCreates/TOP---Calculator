# TOP---Calculator 
https://lucascreates.github.io/TOP---Calculator/

This is the final project of the Odin Project's Foundation course. The objective was to use everything we learnt plus some further researching to build a calculator. We was asked for it to have the basic math operators, addition, subtraction, division and multiplication functionality. I went above and beyond with this project as I wanted to challenge myself further and added addtional UX to the calculator. I did this by addind buttons that allowed further mathematical calculations to be done. The buttons added are as follow, a square button as well as a square root, factorial, exponant, percentage and finally, a plus-minus option.

All of the advance options came with their challenges alongside the main project...
